# Shopify App Node (with üçü)

This repo is a reference for little bits to add to the Shopify App Node boilerplate.

The additional code is from me banging my head and finding bits and pieces from Shopify's various repos, GitHub threads, etc.

- Added support for multiple pages via next.js;
- Added example of various navigation that works;
- Added CustomSessionStorage via Redis;
- Added example of REST API call;

All thanks to Shopify engineering team for providing a great start to make awesome Shopify apps!!!
